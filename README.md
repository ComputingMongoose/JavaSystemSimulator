# JavaSystemSimulator

A computer system simulator (CPU, memory, peripherals) written in Java. The intent is to create not only a basic working simulation, but a look and feel of the simulated system.

Releases are available as Tags: https://github.com/ComputingMongoose/JavaSystemSimulator/tags

Pre-built jar files are available for each release. The syntax for running the simulator is:
```
java -jar JavaSystemSimulator.jar <simulation_folder>
```

The simulation folder must contain a simulation.json file with the simulation configuration and any required resource files (for example ROM images).

Example simulations are available in the Simulations project: https://github.com/ComputingMongoose/Simulations
