I changed some of the files to account for 8088 specifics. It seems the files, in spite of the 80186 name, are actually created from a much newer system and do not account for certain differences with older systems (especially the 8088).

CPU differences are described in the 80386 Programmer's Reference Manual, Section 15.6: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/readings/i386/s15_06.htm
